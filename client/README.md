# Problem Statement

People go to the store to buy things, but sometimes those things may not be available in that store. This waste lot of time for people who want to buy things and not find them in the store they went to.

# Solutions

By using peekNShop users can look at the store's inventory and know whether the items they are looking for are available or not. They can also find the best deal in terms of cost and quality for the items they are looking for with our application.

# Project description:
The application displays the inventories of the stores that the user wants to see on the website. The application has all kinds of filters from which the user can look at his choices of where he wants to buy and make an informed decision.
